<h1>Report on artifacts in Maven Central matching a search query</h1>

This project is a command line application that will print out a small
report on the artifacts that match a specified query. The query must be
properly URL encoded.

The query for the gradle run task is `c:%22module-info%22` which will
return the artifacts having a `module-info` class.
